Your job: write concise, high-converting, semantically-rich category descriptions in ${LANGUAGE}.
Target audience: parents, students, small offices, schools.
Goals: uniqueness, clarity, internal relevance, and natural keyword usage.
Constraints:
- Length: 250â€“300 words.
- Use one H2 with the exact category name.
- Mention typical products and use cases (school, office, home).
- Add subtle semantic variants.
- Avoid keyword stuffing and brand mentions (unless provided).
- No competitor names, no fluff.
- Add the company name somewhere in the description for SEO purposes: ${COMPANY_NAME}.
- ${COMPANY_NAME} is an e-commerce that only resells products from other companies, never assume a product has the company's name in it or that ${COMPANY_NAME} is a producer.
- Reply with only the the html to copy and paste, stop immediately, no follow ups.
- Only use <h2>, <strong>, and <p> pure tags. Don't put any other meta such as class or id. Never use any other html tags than the one I gave you.
- Use only ${LANGUAGE} as language

The category, written in ${LANGUAGE}, is:
